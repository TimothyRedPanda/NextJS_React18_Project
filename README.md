## So what is this project?

Welcome to Red Panda Studio's portfolio/learning platform.

This is a place for me (Timothy) to create a Next.js website
that I can be proud of and help other developers thrive.
I will continuously add tips, tricks, and a place to express
myself through my coding adventures.
Thank you for taking a look, and I hope you stick around and grow this page.
Feel
free to look at the codebase, fork it or whatever takes your fancy.
This is all about enjoying this developer's journey.
Thanks again,

Timothy (Red Panda Studios)

## About Me
Well, funnily enough my name is not actually `Red Panda` but they are my favourite animal.
I'm Timothy from Cheltenham, and after being a pet photographer for nine years, I wanted to take a running jump into new
challenges and therefore
found myself in the world of web and software development.
I completed the intensive bootcamp at School of Code and haven't looked back.
I am loving the journey and really found something that makes me incredibly happy to be a part of.
Let's do this thing!
Want to talk code
or just have a look
at what this little old developer is doing day to day then:

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timothybridgecode/) and send us a message.
Always up for making new connections.
