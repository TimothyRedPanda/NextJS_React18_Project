## So what is this project?

Well, in simple terms, this is a project to help people learn React/JavaScript/Next.
Currently, it is mainly placeholders
but will be expanded upon as I go along.
Thanks for taking a look at this initial setUp and look forward to sharing further progress as it gets worked on.
The reason I have set this up on a new project is I wanted to take Red Panda Studios and make it the best it can be.
Really excited to take this onwards and upwards.
